# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Landmark locations map - User inputs landmark and code locates and draws said landmark on map of the US

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Group: Laina Bockus, Caitlyn Conover, Harshini Nuti

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is it too simple? It may take awhile to locate and input all the information, but should we expand on the idea and make it more complicated or in-depth?
